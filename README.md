# Contact-Management-System
A Swing interface for the contact list

We have a set of acquaintances. The acquaintances are of various types. At the moment
the types of acquaintances to be supported are: relatives, personal friends, professional friends, and casual
acquaintances. For all acquaintances, you can remember the name, mobile number, and e-mail. Again then for some specific acquaintances, you can remember some specific details.
